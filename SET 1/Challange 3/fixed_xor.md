We know what a XOR logical operation do i.e. if any of the input is diffrent than one other the result will be true.
A B AxorB
0 0  0
1 0  1
0 1  1
1 1  0
The function zip() basically it returns a zip object
a =(1,2,3)
b=(4,5,6)
x= zip(a,b)
output will be this
((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))
now the for i,j in zip(str1,str2)
1 4
2 5
3 6 
In these way we are able to XOR them properly
